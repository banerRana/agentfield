# {{.ProjectName}}

Minimal Brain agent scaffold generated on {{.CreatedAt}}.

## What you get
- `main.py` with one router, two reasoners, and one skill
- Mock responses so you can run without LLM keys
- Commented `app.ai(...)` and `app.call(...)` examples for when you're ready

## Run it with the Brain server
1. **Start the Brain control plane** (from any directory):
   ```bash
   brain dev
   ```
   This launches the Brain server at `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Start this agent** (new terminal, inside the project directory):
   ```bash
   brain run {{.ProjectName}}
   ```
   The CLI reads `brain-package.yaml`, picks a free port, and registers the node with the Brain server.

3. **Optional debugging path:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   python main.py
   ```
   Ensure `BRAIN_SERVER_URL` points at your running Brain server when using this shortcut.

## Call the reasoner through Brain
All execution flows through the Brain server, not the agent's local port:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/execute/{{.NodeID}}.summarize_notes \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"notes": "Ship router integration"}}'
```

The response includes the mock summary plus execution tracking metadata.

## Enable real AI later
1. Add your model keys to `.env`
2. Uncomment the `quickstart.ai(...)` or `quickstart.call(...)` snippets in `main.py`
3. Restart the agent with `brain run {{.ProjectName}}`

## Next tweaks
- Rename `node_id` in `main.py` to match your Brain naming scheme
- Add more routers to keep larger projects organized
- Replace the mock responses with your actual logic once credentials are in place
